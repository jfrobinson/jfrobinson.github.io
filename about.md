## Location
Our laboratory is located at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
## Our Research Aims
During pregnancy, humans are exposed to thousands of unique environmental chemicals with unknown consequences. Our laboratory aims to identify the mechanistic links between environmental exposures *in utero* and developmental disease. To study these relationships, we employ alternative model systems which recapitulate the dynamic components of human embryonic/fetal development, and use a combination of classical molecular, genomic, imaging and *in silico* based approaches. We are currently studying a variety of environmental chemical hazards such as flame retardants, plasticizers, pesticides, fracking compounds, and heavy metals. We anticipate that our research—which coalesces elements of developmental toxicology, genomics, and risk assessment—will lead to the discovery of gene-environment interactions underlying toxicity, and future prevention of specific chemical exposures that occur during human pregnancy.

## Ongoing Research Projects

### Establishing alternative models for developmental toxicology. 
As alternatives to classical animal testing, we aim to establish relevant models that represent aspects of human pregnancy that can be used to screen and characterize environmental compounds for their ability to induce developmental toxicity. Models currently being developed in our laboratory include: 1) [a multi-stage human embryonic stem cell model of neurogenesis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26827931); 2) [a human primary villous cytotrophoblast model of placentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323933); and 3) [a rodent whole embryo culture model of early organogenesis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22262562). 

### Developing strategies to integrate diverse toxicogenomic data. 
To examine the underlying molecular relationships between environmental chemical exposures and developmental disease, we employ global, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic analyses. These data may be used to determine potential mechanisms of action and define common modes of toxicity across classes of hazardous compounds.    

We are developing approaches to integrate toxicogenomic data to identify 1) candidate biomarkers for toxicological screening for [developmental toxicity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26827931) and 2)  molecular signatures linked with specific chemical exposures, *e.g.*, [methylmercury](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21664453), [phthalates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22841773).  

### Environmental exposures and placental disease. 
Utilizing human placental *in vitro* model systems, we are investigating the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and placental disease. In collaborations with Dr. Susan Fisher's laboratory, we are studying 

### Human biomarkers of environmental exposures during human pregnancy.
We aim to extend our knowledge of relationships discovered in controlled experiments, by evalauting candidate molecular and mophological correlates identified in experimentally controlled *in vitro* or *in vivo*

### Human xenobiotic metabolism and
