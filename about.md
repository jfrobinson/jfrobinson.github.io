## Location
<img src="https://github.com/jfrobinson/jfrobinson.github.io/blob/master/img/UCSF%20buildingm.jpg" width="450" height="300" align="right"> Our laboratory is located on the 16th floor of the East Wing of the Health Sciences building (Parnassus campus) in the [Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences](https://obgyn.ucsf.edu/) and [Center for Reproductive Sciences](https://obgyn.ucsf.edu/center-reproductive-sciences/welcome-center-reproductive-sciences) at the [University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)](https://www.ucsf.edu/).
## Our Research Aims
During pregnancy, humans are exposed to thousands of unique environmental chemicals with unknown consequences. Our laboratory aims to identify the mechanistic links between environmental exposures *in utero* and developmental disease. To study these relationships, we employ alternative model systems which recapitulate the dynamic components of human embryonic/fetal development, and use a combination of classical molecular, genomic, imaging and *in silico* based approaches. We are currently studying a variety of environmental chemical hazards such as flame retardants, plasticizers, pesticides, fracking compounds, and heavy metals. We anticipate that our research—which coalesces elements of developmental toxicology, genomics, and risk assessment—will lead to the discovery of gene-environment interactions underlying toxicity, and future prevention of specific chemical exposures that occur during human pregnancy.
## Projects
### Establishing alternative models for developmental toxicology. 
As alternatives to classical animal testing, we aim to establish relevant models that represent aspects of human pregnancy that can be used to screen and characterize environmental compounds for their ability to induce developmental toxicity. Models currently being developed in our laboratory include: 1) [a multi-stage human embryonic stem cell model of neurogenesis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26827931); 2) [a human primary villous cytotrophoblast model of placentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323933); and 3) [a rodent whole embryo culture model of early organogenesis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22262562). 
### Developing strategies to integrate diverse toxicogenomic data. 
To examine the underlying molecular relationships between environmental chemical exposures and developmental disease, we employ global, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses. These data may be used to determine potential mechanisms of action and define common modes of toxicity across classes of hazardous compounds. We are developing approaches to integrate toxicogenomic data to facilitate the identification of 1) candidate biomarkers for toxicological screening for [developmental toxicity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26827931) and 2) chemical-specific molecular signatures, *e.g.*, [methylmercury](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21664453), [phthalates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22841773).  
### 
### Environmental exposures and placental disease. 
The placenta acts as the critical lifeline between the maternal and fetal environments, regulating nutrients, wastes, and gases, as well as serving as a metabolic barrier from many xenobiotic insults. We study how environmental chemicals may alter placental development and underlie pregnancy complications. Utilizing [human placental *in vitro* model systems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323933), we are investigating the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and placental toxicity.

### Pesticides and sensitivity to infectious disease.
Pesticides are used at high levels in communities to eliminate disease vectors, *e.g.*, mosquitoes, to reduce the transmission of pathogens and parasites in human populations. We are interested in the potential for these compounds to cause adverse developmental consequences and their role in infectious disease susceptibility. In a collaboration with [Dr. Stephanie Gaw](http://profiles.ucsf.edu/stephanie.valderramos), we are studying potential interactions linking pesticide-toxicity, Zika-disease transmission, and related disease pathologies.
