## Our Research Aims
During pregnancy, humans are exposed to thousands of unique environmental chemicals with unknown consequences. Our laboratory aims to identify the mechanistic links between environmental exposures *in utero* and developmental disease. To study these relationships, we employ alternative model systems which recapitulate the dynamic components of human embryonic/fetal development, and use a combination of classical molecular, genomic, imaging and *in silico* based approaches. We are currently studying a variety of environmental chemical hazards such as flame retardants, plasticizers, pesticides, fracking compounds, and heavy metals. We anticipate that our research—which coalesces elements of developmental toxicology, genomics, and risk assessment—will lead to the discovery of gene-environment interactions underlying toxicity, and future prevention of specific chemical exposures that occur during human pregnancy.

## Ongoing Research Projects

### Establishing alternative models for developmental toxicology. 
We aim to develop relevant alternative models that represent aspects of human pregnancy that can be used to screen and characterize environmental compounds for their ability to induce developmental toxicity. Models currently being used in our laboratory include: 1) a multi-stage human embryonic stem cell model of neurogenesis; 2) a human primary villous cytotrophoblast model of placentation; and 3) a rodent whole embryo culture model of early organogenesis. 

### Developing strategies to integrate diverse toxicogenomic data.

### Environmental exposures and placental disease. 
Utilizing human placental model systems, we are investigating the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and placental disease. In collaborations with Dr. Susan Fisher,
