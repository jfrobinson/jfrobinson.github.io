## Joshua Robinson, PhD
As an Assistant Professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), I lead an independent research program aimed at studying the developmental biological consequences of environmental chemical exposures during early pregnancy and their mechanistic links with placental/developmental disease. I am interested in the application of *in vitro* model systems and genomic-based approaches to evaluate developmental toxicities. I have a broad background in developmental and placental toxicology, environmental health, and genomics. In 2008, I received a Ph.D. in Toxicology at the University of Washington (PI: Dr. Elaine Faustman), where I studied the effects of heavy metal exposures *in utero* during neurulation. I continued my career as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM; PI: Dr. Aldert Piersma) and UCSF (PI: Dr. Susan Fisher) where I participated in several projects that employed a range of alternative in vitro models and used next generation genomic-based methodologies, to study the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and developmental toxicity.

## Kenisha Williams Puckett (Master's Student)
Kenisha is a Master's student at San Francisco State University (SFSU; Cell and Molecular Biology) who is conducting her research project at UCSF (working since September, 2016). Her previous training includes a BS in Cell Biology (UC Riverside) and over 2+ years experience working in basic research. For her Master's project, Kenisha is examining how a specific class of flame retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), found in consumer products and ubiquitous environmental contaminants, may contribute to human placental diseases such as preeclampsia and pre-term birth. Using a primary human cytotrophoblast model, she is studying the effects of PBDEs on the ability of CTBs to invade and migrateâ€•critical aspects of trophoblast development during pregnancy. In the near future, Kenisha plans to obtain a PhD at an research-intensive university in stem cell/reproductive biology.

## Nikita Iyer (Volunteer)
Nikita is a rising junior at UC Berkeley (Major: Immunology & Pathogenesis), who hopes to acquire a PhD in the biomedical sciences.   
She is particularly interested in studying methods and approaches used to identify and uncover links between risk factors, *e.g.*, infection, environmental, nutritional, and human developmental disease. 

## Christopher Yan
I'm Christopher Yan. I was drafted by the Golden State Warriors but I made Klay Thompson look bad. I do science now.
