## Kenisha Williams Puckett (Master's Student)
Kenisha is a Master's student at San Francisco State University (SFSU; Cell and Molecular Biology) who is conducting her research project at UCSF. Her previous training includes a BS in Cell Biology (UC Riverside) and over 2+ years experience working in basic research. For her Master's project, Kenisha is examining how a specific class of flame retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), found in consumer products and ubiquitous environmental contaminants, may contribute to human placental diseases such as preeclampsia and pre-term birth. Using a primary human cytotrophoblast model, she is studying the direct effects of PBDEs on the ability of CTBs to invade and migrateâ€•critical aspects of trophoblast development during pregnancy. Her findings will result in a better understanding of the links between environmental exposures during pregnancy and adverse health outcomes. In the near future, Kenisha plans to obtain a PhD at an research-intensive university in stem cell/reproductive biology.
