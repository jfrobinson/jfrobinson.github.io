## Joshua Robinson, PhD
As an Assistant Professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), I lead an independent research program aimed at studying the developmental biological consequences of environmental chemical exposures during early pregnancy and their mechanistic links with placental/developmental disease. I am interested in the application of *in vitro* model systems and genomic-based approaches to evaluate developmental toxicities. I have a broad background in developmental and placental toxicology, environmental health, and genomics. In 2008, I received a Ph.D. in Toxicology at the University of Washington (PI: Dr. Elaine Faustman), where I studied the effects of heavy metal exposures *in utero* during neurulation. I continued my career as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM; PI: Dr. Aldert Piersma) and UCSF (PI: Dr. Susan Fisher) where I participated in several projects that employed a range of alternative in vitro models and used next generation genomic-based methodologies, to study the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and developmental toxicity.

## Kenisha Williams Puckett (Master's Student)
Kenisha is a Master's student at San Francisco State University (SFSU; Cell and Molecular Biology) who is conducting her research project at UCSF (working since September, 2016). Her previous training includes a BS in Cell Biology (UC Riverside) and over 2+ years experience working in basic research. For her Master's project, Kenisha is examining how a specific class of flame retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), found in consumer products and ubiquitous environmental contaminants, may contribute to human placental diseases such as preeclampsia and pre-term birth. Using a primary human cytotrophoblast model, she is studying the effects of PBDEs on the ability of CTBs to invade and migrate―critical aspects of trophoblast development during pregnancy. In the near future, Kenisha plans to obtain a PhD at an research-intensive university in stem cell/reproductive biology.

## Nikita Iyer (Volunteer)
Nikita is a rising junior at UC Berkeley (Major: Immunology & Pathogenesis), who hopes to acquire a PhD in the biomedical sciences.   
She is particularly interested in studying methods and approaches used to identify and uncover links between risk factors, *e.g.*, infection, environmental, nutritional, and human developmental disease. 

## Christopher Yan
I'm Christopher Yan. I was drafted by the Golden State Warriors but I made Klay Thompson look bad. I do science now.
