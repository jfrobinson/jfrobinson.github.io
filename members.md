## Joshua Robinson, PhD
As an Assistant Professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), I lead an independent research program aimed at studying the developmental biological consequences of environmental chemical exposures during early pregnancy and their mechanistic links with placental/developmental disease. I am interested in the application of *in vitro* model systems and genomic-based approaches to evaluate developmental toxicities. I have a broad background in developmental and placental toxicology, environmental health, and genomics. In 2008, I received a Ph.D. in Toxicology at the University of Washington (PI: Dr. Elaine Faustman), where I studied the effects of heavy metal exposures *in utero* during neurulation. I continued my career as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM; PI: Dr. Aldert Piersma), where I participated in several projects that employed a range of alternative animal models and used genomic-based approaches, to study the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and developmental toxicity. At UCSF, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow (PI: Dr. Susan Fisher) to expand my expertise in human embryonic stem cell and placental biology and next-generation genomic methodologies, and studied the impacts of flame retardant exposures in the human embryo and placenta *in vitro*.

## Kenisha Williams Puckett (Master's Student)
Kenisha is a Master's student at San Francisco State University (SFSU; Cell and Molecular Biology) who is conducting her research project at UCSF. Her previous training includes a BS in Cell Biology (UC Riverside) and over 2+ years experience working in basic research. For her Master's project, Kenisha is examining how a specific class of flame retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), found in consumer products and ubiquitous environmental contaminants, may contribute to human placental diseases such as preeclampsia and pre-term birth. Using a primary human cytotrophoblast model, she is studying the effects of PBDEs on the ability of CTBs to invade and migrateâ€•critical aspects of trophoblast development during pregnancy. In the near future, Kenisha plans to obtain a PhD at an research-intensive university in stem cell/reproductive biology.
